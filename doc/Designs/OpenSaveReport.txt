Design of Open, Save, Save as Report

Open
  1) Client: if a report is currently open or the user has entered some report definition information - 
             confirm that they are OK to discard that information (if not - exit process)
  2) Client: send request to server for list of reports to open (user)
  3) Server: put together list of reports available to user and send to client
  4) Client: receive and display returned list
  5) User:   user selects report to open
  6) Client: send request for desired report to server (user, group, report name)
  7) Server: pulls the information for that report and returns to client 
             (user, group, report name, [dimensions, row, columns, facts])
  8) Client: a) clear out old report information
             b) load opened report information into dimensions, rows, columns, and facts
             c) Call routine that is called when the "All Report Fields" button is clicked.
