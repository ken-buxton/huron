Huron - Coding Bug List

DIM DATA
* 1) If a change is made to an attributes selections and context is then switched to a different
     dimension then the recent change is lost, unless the user clicks refresh before switching.
     Issue with clicking checkbox not changing underlying html. Hmmm...
     See function set_selections for details on how to set the underlying HTML.
    
FACT DATA FIELDS REPORT
* 1) Shows Ascending/Descending choice for sort column. 
     Should include None (No Sort.) Should default to None.
* 2) Calculation button. Should prompt: Fact - Row <x> <table>.<field> calculation:
* 3) Cancel Header Name prompt displays "null".
  4) Calculation - don't allow entry of rows that don't exist (A, B, etc.)

REPORT DISPLAY REQUEST
* 1) When the dimension attributes are being combined to be sent to the server, only the currently selected
     dimension (if any) can be formatted properly because it relies on the HTML being within the <DIV> id="RD_edit".
     Create a temporary <DIV> id="RD_edit_tmp" and change the id's to use "SEL__tmpxxx" instead of "SEL_xxx" as
     the id. Then use the temporary <DIV> to build the dimension request values.  
* 2) If a dimension has been updated but hasn't been switched away from, the html is not saved and when you request
     to display a report the fields and values you've selected won't be shown. Maybe we should save the HTML any
     time we make a change to a dimension selection.
*    a) Start with doing update whenever user clicks Refresh.
*    b) Eventually, update the html anytime the user changes a select (but no ajax request involved.)
* 3) When you have multiple attributes selected for a dimension, only the values for the first one is sent with the
     report request. Changed function RRA_get_report() to do a global replace on the SEL_ id values. Before was
     only replacing the first one.
* 4) When formatting the in clause of a where clause it is adding an additional blank in field. Needed to do the
     loop on 0..(n-1) rather than 0..n.
